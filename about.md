I am currently a PhD student in the Intelligent Knowledge Management lab
  at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan.
I was born in New Zealand and also spent many years in Australia,
  where I originally studied philosophy.
You can see my curriculum vitae here.

My research focuses on natural language understanding particularly
  related to computational argumentation.
My goal is to create an argument retrieval system for scientific and
  academic knowledge, backed by a map of the argumentative terrain of
  of all knowledge.
For example, a researcher can input a hypothesis and retrieve not only specific
  documents, but specific arguments for or against that hypothesis.
It is my hope that such a system will be able to accelerate knowledge
  generation.

Needless to say, this goal is a way off yet.
However, I believe I can see at least a way to proceed towards that goal
  which I will attempt to outline progressively in my blog posts
  and research papers.
