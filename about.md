I am currently a PhD student in the Intelligent Knowledge Management
  lab at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan.
I was born in New Zealand and also spent many years in Australia,
  where I originally studied philosophy.
I spent some years as a software engineer, then moved to Taiwan to study
  Chinese and teach English, before starting my PhD in computer science.

My research focuses on natural language understanding particularly
  related to computational argumentation.
My goal is to create an argument-based retrieval system for scientific
  and academic knowledge, backed by a map of the argumentative terrain
  of all scientific knowledge.
For example, a researcher can input a hypothesis and retrieve not only
  specific documents, but specific arguments for or against that
  hypothesis.
It is my hope that such a system will be able to accelerate the
  advancement of knowledge.
