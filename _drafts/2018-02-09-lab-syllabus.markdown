NOTES:
- practical focus
- implementation practice for everything
- CCQ heavy
- Standard test for each unit (oral) + demonstration of implementations?

Machine Learning Basics:
- Stanford's stat learning intro chapter
  - function learning
  - bias and variance
- Basic techniques (Ng's course?):
  - Linear Regression + Non-Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - SVMs
- Unsupervised Learning:
  - k-means clustering
  - other???
- DL book:
  - curse of dimensionality
  - other???

Other things encountered in the above:
- Cross-validation
- Boosting and bagging
- Ensemble methods
- Evaluation
- Loss functions -> machine learning recipe (DL book?)

Neural Network Basics (NLP focus):
- Feedforward network
- Distributed representations of words
  - Bengio (2003)
  - word2vec
  - GloVe
  - knowing how to get embeddings, and how to use them - i.e. make vocab dict
    and embedding matrix for a given dataset
- RNNs
  - basic RNN - Ellman's insight; Kaparthy's blog
  - Vanishing gradient problem (workbook from Stanford, ba)
  - Improvements: LSTM and GRU
- CNNs:
  - ...?

Advanced Neural Network stuff:
- Memory networks
- Reinforcement learning
- GANs
- ???
