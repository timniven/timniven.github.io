    <p>I was recently <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2RhdGFza2VwdGljLmNvbS9mZWVkLnJzcw&amp;episode=MzdjYzU5NWM5YzNlNDJmMWEzOTM0OTAwODJhYzdhOWI&amp;hl=en-TW&amp;ep=6&amp;at=1569665805799">interviewed about our ACL 2019 paper on Data Skeptic.</a>
Many thanks to the Data Skeptic team for inviting me to participate in
this interview, for asking some great questions, and for cutting the 
interview as nicely as I think possible given what raw materials I
provided.</p>

<p>It was my first ever interview of this nature, and a learning experience
for me. I was only able to assign a limited amount of time to prepare
for this interview. This post is a brief note about what I wish I had
done better, and another statement of an argument I made about 
empricism and nativism in AI - especially topical in light of the release
of <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Rebooting-AI-Gary-Marcus/9781524748258">Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis’ new book</a>.</p>

<p>In the main, I should have referenced other researchers more.
A conversational style is nice and relaxed, but clarifying
 where ideas come from is required and non-negotiable.
Most of the ideas I presented are not original. For example, the idea 
that supervised learning with text
is facing a Chinese Room argument I first read in a paper by
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07432">Douwe Kiela</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=aJ8aqmEmOb4&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIU9cQ1JdC7Y%26feature%3Dshare&amp;fbclid=IwAR3zb8sPtuM7JKJkfei1nkEG3P8n01KH7262nSwBokj_-RTrlNeri5bida4">Yoshua Bengio has also
been arguing for grounded language learning recently</a>,
 and for being more willing to look at the results of cognitive science,
 and for the important of out-of-distribution generalization.</p>

<p>As far as I know, perhaps the only original opinion expressed in the 
interview, beyond the results of our paper, was the counter-argument
offered by our work to an “Argument from engineering success” for the
kind of strongly empiricist program of people like Yann LeCun. I briefly
reiterate that argument here.</p>

<p>I don’t know all the reasons why Yann LeCun sees innate structure as an 
“evil” to be minimized. However, watching
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdWPQ6iAkT4">his debate with Gary Marcus</a>,
among those reasons appears to
be what could be called an “argument from engineering success”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) The less innate structure we put into our models, the better they 
      have performed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) Engineering success is a strong indication of the right path, 
      scientifically.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) Therefore, less innate structure is better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We of course need to define what we mean by innate structure. From the 
same debate, it appears LeCun and Marcus have different ideas of what 
this means. Marcus argues that NIPS papers roundly ignore innate 
structure; LeCun states exactly the opposite is the case. That’s a 
question I want to return to in the future.</p>

<p>But for the time being, the growing number of findings in NLP that 
demonstrate our best deep learning models are learning spurious 
solutions to datasets via superficial statistics immediately undermines
(1), since this improved performance does not represent the kind of
learning we care about.</p>

<p>Bengio (who I continue to admire greatly, not just for his scientific
achievements, which are amazing, but perhaps even more for how much of a 
high quality human being he is - see his work on AI for social good, and
his passionate advocacy for action on climate change) has also been 
taking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llGG62fNN64&amp;fbclid=IwAR2tX_GQX7ohJ92zJlm4_Fuj7-QEpZ0ggX-z_cu8reXZehacWm08KUbBWhM">a view of recent
deep learning success as specifically “System 1” success</a>,
 in terms of Kahneman’s “systems theory.” If this view is correct, then 
the argument from engineering success should be modified as follows</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) The less innate structure we put into our models, the better they 
      have performed <strong>at system 1 tasks</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) Engineering success is a strong indication of the right path, 
      scientifically.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) Therefore, less innate structure is better <strong>for system 1 tasks</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This argument is at least more reasonable given the growing evidence I 
referred to in my counter-argument, although I am not prepared to 
judge it at this point in time.</p>

<p>As for system 2 tasks, we will have to wait and see. But at the very
least there is a reasonable case for taking the results of cognitive
science, and <a href="https://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/Defense.pdf">contemporary nativism</a>, seriously.</p>
